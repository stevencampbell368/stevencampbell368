Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! Here, you'll find a showcase of various tasks and projects I've completed, with more to come.

I'm committed to staying updated on the latest cybersecurity trends. I regularly listen to cyber podcasts, follow industry professionals, and take online courses like the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. As of July 2024, I'm preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification.
